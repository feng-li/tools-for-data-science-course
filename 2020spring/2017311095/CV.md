My English name is Steven,and I am from Shandong province.If I can only use three words to describe myself,I think I am a multi-faceted and attitude person with diverse ideas and thoughts.Interestingly, before making my own answer,I also asked the three most important friends in my heart the same question with curiosity. Their answers are: nostalgia, good at doing things, rigorous, know what he wants, follow the heart, fit, rational, creative and thoughtful. However, compared with these,I would like to share my hobbies again, hoping to find people with similar interests. I am fond of basketball and tennis.I like Tv series such a **The Game of Thrones**,Sherlock Holmes,and **House of Cards**.I like the songs created by **Eason Chan** and **Adele**.I also likes Nolan's movies and Chopin's music. Finally,I am obsessed with Weibo.
